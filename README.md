### ðŸ‘‹ Hello World

I am a Full Stack Engineer with over 5 years of experience in JavaScript/TypeScript, having worked in various companies across different sectors in both Brazil and the USA.

Here are some characteristics that have set me apart in the companies I've worked for:

* ðŸ’¼ **Diverse Experience**: I've worked on projects in various fields such as Architecture, Accounting, E-commerce, Maritime Transport, and Fintech, which allowed me to face numerous unique challenges.

* ðŸš€ **Adaptability**: To solve these problems, I had to adapt to different frameworks used by each company, such as Vue, React, Next, Nest, and Adonis. Additionally, I have experience with AWS and GCP, as well as relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, and non-relational ones like Redis and MongoDB.

* ðŸŽ“ **Responsibility**: I was responsible for developing and designing two systems from scratch: a basic ERP for a company and an RPG character sheet manager, both of which are still in use today, demonstrating my ability to help people with my technical and practical knowledge.
